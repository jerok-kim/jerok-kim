I've done:
- MQTT protocol-based Vehicle-Status-Synchronization service development

I'm doing:
- Middleware library for real-time big data aggregation from Connected-Car-Service apps and transmission to center

interest now:
I am working with system services on the AOSP platform and often encounter tombstone issues.
To improve my debugging skills related to these issues, I am studying ARM architecture, Android internals, Linux OS, C, and Assembly.
Additionally, as Ethernet (SOME/IP) technology is increasingly used in automotive communication, I am studying it alongside CAN communication.
